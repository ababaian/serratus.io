# How to contribute

serratus.io is under active development. This document is in place to make it easier for anyone to help us.

## Serratus Project Overview

There are 3 repositories:

1. [ababaiain/serratus](https://github.com/ababaiain/serratus) : Repository for Serratus bioinformatics/computational analyses
2. [serratus-bio/serratus.io](https://github.com/serratus-bio/serratus.io) : Repository for Serratus front-facing website
3. [serratus-bio/serratus-db](https://github.com/serratus-bio/serratus-db) : Repository for Serratus database curation and API

## Getting Started

### Finding a task

- See the [issues page](https://github.com/serratus-bio/serratus.io/issues) for tasks that could use some help. You can filter by the **good first issue** label.
    - Alternatively, visit the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/serratus-bio/projects/1?fullscreen=true) which includes tasks from serratus-db.
- Feel free to comment on any issue, even those you're not assigned to if you have a helpful suggestion.
- If you'd like to work on a given task, simply add a comment saying this to the issue and it will be "Assigned" to you.

### Running the site locally

1. Make sure you have `npm` installed.
2. Clone the repository and run the following commands:

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Create a topic branch from the `dev` branch. We use the following branch naming structure:
    - Features: `feature/<username>/<description>` (example: `feature/victorlin/add-explore-page`)
    - Enhancements: `update/<username>/<description>` (example: `update/victorlin/add-dropdown-select`)
    - Bug fixes: `fix/<username>/<description>` (example: `fix/victorlin/query-page-floating`)
- Make commits of logical and atomic units, with meaningful messages.
